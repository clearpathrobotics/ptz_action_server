Changelog for package axis_ptz_action_server
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

0.1.9 (2024-01-09)
------------------
* Fix a bug in translating the zoom level from the logical to hardware range
* Contributors: Chris Iverach-Brereton

0.1.8 (2024-01-08)
------------------
* Apply the logical -> physical zoom scaling when sending the absolute zoom level to the Axis driver. Remove an unnecessary debug print
* Contributors: Chris Iverach-Brereton

0.1.7 (2023-11-22)
------------------

0.1.6 (2023-11-15)
------------------
* Major overhaul to add new control modes (`#4 <https://github.com/clearpathrobotics/ptz_action_server/issues/4>`_)
  * Rename PtzPosition.msg to PtzState.msg, add support for velocity control. Rename .../move_ptz action to .../position, add .../velocity to Axis camera to allow velocity control
  * Add support for move_ptz/position_abs and move_ptz/position_rel actions
  * Update the readme
  * Add support for absolute & relative positions for the flir PTU
  * Move the axis server's actions into the move_ptz namespace, add position_abs and position_rel
  * Update the limits config files, readme for the axis action server
  * Keep all nodes called "ptz_action_server_node" for all nodes by default to make searching params easier
  * Make the ROS parameters consistent across all implementations. Add limits file for the simulation node
  * Publish the sign of the direction of travel in velocity control feedback. Check if the camera has reached end-of-travel and signal the end of the velocity control action if this occurs
  * Debug the new action servers on actual hardware
  * Add the first-pass at supporting pan/tilt angles relative to an external frame. Not yet supported by the Flir PTU
  * Create a temporary vector frame we can use to calculate the necessary pan/tilt angles, rather than ignoring the tilt. This should allow the camera to operate correctly even on hills. Temporary frame has a UUID in the name so it shouldn't conflict with other frames in the robot
  * Modify the axis & simulation packages to use positive pan = clockwise instead of anticlockwise. Add a new action to pan/tilt/zoom to a specific frame
  * Fix message dependencies
  * Implement the new action to point the camera AT a specific frame, instead of just parallel with its X axis
* Contributors: Chris Iverach-Brereton

0.1.5 (2023-10-19)
------------------
* Fix endline
* Restore limits_dome.yaml file as an example.
* Set the is_moving flag _after\_ we send the command to the camera hardware, just to prevent possible issues with feedback kicking out early
* Add an additional check to make sure the camera hasn't stopped moving. Make setting self.is_moving atomic with a setter function and a lock
* Add a new config file for dome cameras mounted upside-down
* `self.ptz_state.pan` and `.tilt` are already in radians; don't covnert them again
* Rename file and add environment variables to set ptz limits
* Contributors: Chris Iverach-Brereton, José Mastrangelo

* Merge pull request `#3 <https://github.com/clearpathrobotics/ptz_action_server/issues/3>`_ from clearpathrobotics/ONAV-1687

0.1.4 (2023-08-18)
------------------
* Add the ability to publish the Axis camera's joint states
* Contributors: Chris Iverach-Brereton

0.1.3 (2023-08-04)
------------------

0.1.2 (2023-05-05)
------------------
* Re-send the axis command if the camera isn't moving after 5s
* Add some additional logging, handle camera disconnections better
* Abort the action in-progress if the Axis camera stops publishing state messages
* Use format strings instead of .format
* Contributors: Chris Iverach-Brereton

0.1.1 (2023-04-11)
------------------
* Add limits files for the standard dome camera & Q62 series. Add a new launch argument to specify the limits file
* Contributors: Chris Iverach-Brereton

0.1.0 (2023-03-27)
------------------
* Initial release
* Contributors: Chris Iverach-Brereton
