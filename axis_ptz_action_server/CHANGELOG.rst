Changelog for package axis_ptz_action_server
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

0.1.5 (2023-10-19)
------------------
* Fix endline
* Restore limits_dome.yaml file as an example.
* Set the is_moving flag _after\_ we send the command to the camera hardware, just to prevent possible issues with feedback kicking out early
* Add an additional check to make sure the camera hasn't stopped moving. Make setting self.is_moving atomic with a setter function and a lock
* Add a new config file for dome cameras mounted upside-down
* `self.ptz_state.pan` and `.tilt` are already in radians; don't covnert them again
* Rename file and add environment variables to set ptz limits
* Contributors: Chris Iverach-Brereton, José Mastrangelo

* Merge pull request `#3 <https://github.com/clearpathrobotics/ptz_action_server/issues/3>`_ from clearpathrobotics/ONAV-1687
